SeatID Social Solutions Plugin allows you to implement the SeatID widget onto your WordPress website without the need to add or edit any code.

== Description ==

> SeatID Social Solutions supports online consumers’ selection process by showing them someone they know, or at least someone from their social circles, that has already made a purchase from your brand.

Smart marketers know that social proof is the marketing tactic for easing the minds of worried customers.
With the power of the internet at their fingertips, customers can know an immense amount of information about your business before ever speaking with a salesperson.
The SeatID solution allows you to provide social proof to your future customers by showing them who else bought this. SeatID adds social widgets to existing online ticketing and booking processes and pulls in profile information from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google+ to let users know which of their friends are on which flight, staying at which hotel, attending which concert, etc.
This social proof drives higher engagement and conversion!
